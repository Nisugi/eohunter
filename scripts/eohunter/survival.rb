# loop, escape_rooms and check_for_deaders_prone before every
# command, and a dead_man_switch thread that kills,
# departs or quits when we die. The engine's Survival is those as the
# behavior at priority 0: nothing else runs while we are dead, in an
# escape room, on the ground, or standing over a dead player. Rules and
# bigshot line references in hunting-engine-plan.md, "Survival".
