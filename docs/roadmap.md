# eohunter roadmap (2026-09-10, Lich status updated 2026-10-24)

What is built, what has run in the game, and what is left, in one place.
hunting-engine-plan.md has the rules and bigshot line references per step;
this file is the status board. Update it when a milestone lands or a live
run confirms something.

Status words: **built** means specs pass outside Lich; **live** means seen
working in a real hunt; **gap** means not written yet.

## Milestones

| Milestone | Status | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| P1 lich-5 helpers | done | #1578 Stance, #1579 Stash wield/hands; merged, in Lich 5.22.0 |
| L1 libeo | done | the Fog stand-in is gone: Fog is Lich's (#1584) |
| P2 parser seam | not started | widen Combat::Observers; the engine's Watch does the job for now |
| M0 spike | done, live | hunt-rest-hunt on a real profile |
| M1 solo parity | built, partly live | the checklist below |
| Setup editor | built, partly live | `;eohunter setup`: a GTK hunt editor with Bigshot import, validation against the engine, and routine and custom-Ruby checks |
| L3 libeosettings | not started | Setup scaffold for the e-scripts; independent of eohunter |
| M3 group | built, not live | head and tail, every follower wait, the looter, orders over DRb |
| M4 bounty child | built, not live | `;eohunter bounty` in place of `bigshot bounty`; the group verdict and acknowledged shutdown; ebounty stays the driver and gets the group changes |
| A1 LAB controller | built, not live | bounded profile-routine trials with native safe return and evidence |
| M5 cutover | not started | bsprofiles "Run with eohunter", ebounty setting, ecleanse alias |
| Corpse recovery | gap, designed | a dead group member: re-group, fog or drag home, dragger by strength; two unknowns below |
| Movement barrier | gap, needs a decision | no timeout; a total follower loss opens it vacuously and the leader hunts on alone |
| Profile key audit | gap | eight bigshot keys silently ignored while the plan claims all 103 are honoured or retired |

## Lich pull requests the engine leans on

| PR | What | Engine use |
|---|---|---|
| #1578 Stance | `Lich::Gemstone::Stance.change` | every stance drop |
| #1579 Stash | `wield`, `hands` | recover, wield, store routine words |
| #1580 Mana.pulse | mana pulse | Cleanse rally, spell gates |
| #1581 Bank | silver notes | (ebounty, M4) |
| #1583 PSM readers | `CMan.command`, `results_regex` | maneuvers.rb |
| #1584 Fog | `Lich::Gemstone::Fog.return` | Rest's fog phase |
| #1585 spell refresh | a start message refreshes an active spell | Briar Betrayer timing, every refreshable buff |
| #1586 Combat::Messages | non-combat message families as observer events | the watch |
| #1587 bounded fput | `max_resends`, `interrupt`, failure symbols | the send ladder |

All merged in September 2026 and released together in Lich 5.22.0;
[core-dependencies](guides/core-dependencies.md) has the full list.

Still to open: the scripts-repo effect-list change marking 9105 `span='refreshable'`
(edited locally only).

## M1 checklist: built and live

| Item | Built | Live | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Send ladder, roundtime, confirmations (`bs_put`) | yes | yes | actions.rb; candidate for a core PR (Doug's point) |
| Routine language, modifiers, once registry, repeatdelay | yes | yes | engage.rb |
| Coup de grace gates, `empowered<N>`, `thp<N>` | yes | yes | |
| Cast taxonomy, caststop, resonance rotation, mana pulse | yes | partly | resonance not seen live |
| Mstrike ladder and quickstrike | yes | no | maneuvers.rb |
| UAC tiers, smite, followups | yes | no | routines.rb |
| Wands, wandolier, recover, dislodge | yes | no | routines.rb; `hide_for_ammo` setting not read |
| Ambush and archery aiming | yes | yes | |
| Weapon reaction | yes | no | |
| Assume Aspect from the signs box | yes | yes | |
| Signs, bless, 902/411, wrack | yes | partly | bless not seen live |
| Targets: invalid, appendages, decoys, boons, priority, lone targets | yes | yes | boon ASSESS not seen live |
| Flee: message, hazards, always_flee_from, boons, crowd, ambusher | yes | partly | only the crowd rule seen live |
| Escape rooms: Belly, Ooze, Duskruin, Temporal Rift | yes | no | needs a provoked run |
| Rest reasons: wounded, fried/overkill/LTE, encumbered, dreads, thorns, confusion, oom | yes | partly | wounded and mana seen live |
| Rest cycle, waypoints, resting room, prep, scripts, rally, hunting room | yes | yes | |
| Fog return 1-5, custom fog, fog_optional, fog_rift | yes | no | |
| Loot: script, LOOT #id, delay, final, box in hand, stance, disks | yes | partly | final loot at rest not seen live |
| Deader, pull, stand, depart switch, dead man switch | yes | partly | stand seen live |
| Bandit mode and Ranger tracking | yes | no | |
| Troubadour's Rally, self and group | yes | partly | self seen live after #1585 |
| Cleanse: ecleanse's twelve conditions | yes | partly | disarm recovery and stun seen live |
| go2 supervision, suspension on preemption | yes | yes | mid-trip preemption not seen live |
| Sneaky hunting: hide before moving | yes | no | |
| `movement autosneak on/off` (pre_hunt 7311, rest 7470, 3374) | yes | no | Rest's leave and finish, the script's before_dying |
| Stance Perfection (`cman stance N`, change_stance 6905-6921) | via #1578 | no | `Stance.change` takes the number and uses the cman when trained; the engine passes the profile's stance through |
| Interaction monitor (`monitor_interaction` 6812) | gap | | a GTK alert on watched lines; a Watch rule plus a message would do |
| `hide_for_ammo` | n/a | | bigshot reads the setting and never uses it (only the accessor at 2724) |

## M3 group: built and live

| Item | Built | Live |
|---|---|---|
| Hub over DRb, register, orders, reports, liveness | yes | no |
| head: group open, rally whisper, readiness barrier, timeout | yes | no |
| tail: rally watch, connect, register, wait for activation | yes | no |
| Leader waits: looting done, gathers, quiet followers, rested, sneaky | yes | no |
| Independent travel and return | yes | no |
| Looter choice, loot handed to a follower, follower_overkill | yes | no |
| Attack orders, call a missing follower back, disable_commands | yes | no |
| Muster: stunned member, missing follower between fights | yes | no |
| Follower: Orders, Assist, Follow, Loot on assignment | yes | no |
| Lost follower reported and skipped; lost leader stops the follower | yes | no |
| Group deader; rally for a stunned member | yes | no |

First live run: two characters, one area, `head 1` and `tail`, a full
hunt-rest-hunt cycle. Then kill the follower's Lich mid-hunt (leader keeps
going, reports the loss) and kill the leader's script mid-hunt (follower
stops with hunt_over or leader_lost, no walk to the rest room).

## M4 bounty child: built and what is left

ebounty is not absorbed. It stays the driver for every bounty type and runs
eohunter as the hunt child where it ran bigshot. Built:

| Item | Built | Live |
|---|---|---|
| `;eohunter bounty [<creature>]`: profile from UserVars.op, bounty_eval, bandits from the bounty | yes | no |
| Forced rest on completion; exit at the resting room once prepped (`:rested`) | yes | no |
| Child rescue exit | yes | no |
| Each member's bounty state in its report | yes | no |
| Leader verdict: a lost member before a complete bounty; the done keep assisting | yes | no |
| Acknowledged shutdown with a fifteen-second deadline and the unacked list | yes | no |

### What ebounty needs (its own change, not the engine's)

1. **A hunter setting.** `hunting_script: bigshot | eohunter`. Where `go_hunting`
   runs `bigshot bounty` (2288) and `bigshot bounty <creature>` (2286), run
   `eohunter bounty` and `eohunter bounty <creature>`; `keep_hunting` (2069)
   runs `eohunter <default profile>` once instead of `bigshot single`; the
   `before_dying` kill (3652) and the required-scripts check (3675) name
   whichever is set. Everything else in `go_hunting` stays: the child reads
   `UserVars.op` and `bounty_eval` as it is written today.
2. **The child's exit reason.** eohunter stops with `:bounty_rest` (done and
   rested), `:child_rescue`, `:member_lost`, `:leader_lost`, `:hunt_over`,
   `:dead`, or `:script_killed`. ebounty needs to read it after the child
   dies (a `UserVars` key or a `Script` return value, to be decided) and
   treat `:member_lost` and an unclean shutdown as "do not start the town
   run".
3. **Group bounties.** The leader's ebounty starts `eohunter bounty head <count>`;
   each follower's ebounty starts `eohunter bounty tail`. Each member keeps
   its own task and count. The town phases on a follower (trail the
   leader, turn in, get the next task, sell, report ready) are a new
   follower mode in ebounty; the engine's Hub can carry those signals
   between the two ebounties if wanted, or LNet can.
4. **The bandit flag.** `over_watch` (431) sets `$bigshot_bandits` only while
   bigshot is running; eohunter sets it itself from the bounty text, so
   the thread should check for either child or be dropped.
- The nine failure cases as live acceptance: follower disconnects mid-hunt
  and after completing; leader completes while a follower is mid-swing;
  leader killed with the server dying and surviving; a follower that never
  acks; a stale hunt_over; two hunts on one group; a barrier timeout naming
  the missing member; a profile opened without being applied

`scripts/eohunter/objective.rb` is a withdrawn in-engine bounty cycle, kept
but not loaded. Do not extend it.

## Core consumption (the review criterion)

The audit is `core-consumption-audit.md`. Status:

- actions.rb's send ladder is fput's (lich-5 #1587); settle_rt is
  waitrt? / waitcastrt?
- world.rb: the Forge leftovers are gone (4edaf6c); what is left delegates
- cleanse helpers: Mana.pulse, settle_rt, Actions::Stand (4edaf6c)
- Watch rules: watch.rb subscribes to Combat::Messages, :ucs and :attack
  (lich-5 #1586); the only rule left is the profile's flee text
- the libeo stand-in is gone; Fog is Lich's (#1584)
- routines.rb: two Stash candidates (store a hand, put into a named
  container) not yet opened

The engine therefore needs Lich 5.22.0, the first release with the nine
PRs. The script refuses to start on an older Lich and says to update.

## Corpse recovery: a group member dies (gap, designed not built)

Today a dead group member is announced and the leader stops: Survival's
`deader` emits `:deader` and returns `:deader`, and the `group_deader`
toggle decides whether it fires at all. Nothing recovers the body. bigshot
has no precedent here either - its only DRAG is `_drag` moving a weapon
into a container - so this is new behaviour rather than a parity gap, and
it needs its own design pass rather than an inferred implementation.

The intent, in order:

1. **Re-group them.** Death drops the character from the game's group, so
   the leader re-invites before anything else.
2. **Fog out if fog is configured.** Grab the body first, then fog, so the
   trip home carries them.
3. **Otherwise drag.** `drag #<id>` by id, not noun - two members can share
   a noun, and the pre-movement pull in bigshot uses the id form for the
   same reason. A hand must be empty before the drag will take.
4. **Handle too heavy.** The game refuses a corpse that outweighs the
   dragger; on that refusal, `drag stop` rather than retrying.
5. **Then branch on the room.** Dangerous: leave, and accept the body stays.
   Safe: hold there until it stops being safe, so the group is not split.
6. **Choose the dragger.** The highest strength bonus in the group, or a
   configured member when one is named and available.

### What has to be decided before this is written

- **The refusal text.** The gate for "too heavy" needs the game's actual
  line. A guessed regex gives a branch that silently never fires, which is
  worse than no branch at all. This has to come from a real log.
- **What "dangerous" means.** Any hostile creature present, the flee
  predicate, or something narrower. The room-safety branch is the whole
  difference between leaving a body and stranding the group.
- **Who decides the dragger.** Highest strength bonus means each follower
  reports its bonus, which is a new `Report` field and so a protocol
  change; the alternative is the leader assigning by configured name only.
  `Stats` is already reachable through World, so either is buildable.

### What already exists to build on

`Fog.return` (Rest::Fog), the hand-emptiness readers (`Hands#empty?`,
`#right_empty?`), `Stats` through World, the group's DRb order channel,
and Survival's existing dead-member detection. The pieces are all there;
the sequencing and the two unknowns above are the work.

## The movement barrier has no timeout (gap, needs a decision)

`Leader#movement_ready?` is `all_present? && !roundtime? && (online - acked).empty?`.
A follower that never acknowledges `prepare_move` holds the leader at the
barrier for as long as it stays online, with nothing to end the wait.

Partial loss is already handled: a follower silent past `REPORT_STALE`
drops out of `online`, so the rest proceed without it. The hole is total
loss - `online.all?` on an empty array is `true`, so once every follower
goes quiet the barrier opens rather than blocking, `solo?` is still false
because the registrations remain, and the leader wanders off alone
believing the group is assembled.

Silent here means only "no report in ten seconds", against a three-second
pulse that exists so a busy follower does not read as dead. It cannot tell
a crashed Lich from a network stall from a deliberate `;kill`.

The intended behaviour, from the same conversation as the corpse note:
the leader should go rest and wait rather than hunt on, and before moving
at all it should see that everyone can actually move - standing, not
muckled - including a silent follower who is visibly here. Nobody gets
left behind; a member who is not in the room at all is a separation that
should have been caught when it happened.

Most of that already exists. Survival is priority 0 and Muster is 15, so a
downed group member is pulled before Muster considers moving; `to_pull`
already selects group members who are sitting, lying or prone and not
dead, and the `pull` toggle defaults on. Muster checks `group_member_stunned?`
and roundtime before the barrier.

What is missing:

1. A timeout on the barrier, and a decision about what the leader does
   when it expires: rest and wait is the stated intent.
2. A silent-but-visible follower should still count for presence. It is
   checked for stun today, because that reads room status, but it is
   dropped from `online` and so does not gate movement.
3. The pre-movement pull should use `pull #<id>` and confirm they stood.
   bigshot uses the id form in exactly this spot (do_hunt) and the noun
   form elsewhere, because two members can share a noun; it also retries
   three times and re-checks status between attempts.

## Profile keys: the plan claims more than the code honours (gap)

hunting-engine-plan.md's "Profile compatibility" section states that all
103 bigshot keys are honoured or explicitly retired and nothing is
silently ignored. Eight are silently ignored, and three differ from
bigshot in type or default.

The work is mostly a decision per key - honour it, or declare it retired
and say so in the plan - rather than code. `box_in_hand` is already
handled the second way and can serve as the pattern: the key stays in
RULES so existing profiles load, the Policy does not carry it, and a
comment records why it is deliberately not honoured.

## Order of work

1. Live runs on Lich 5.22.0: bandit mode, Ranger tracking, the final
   loot at rest, fog return, a preempted trip, autosneak, then the
   two-character group run above.
2. A live bounty through ebounty with eohunter as the child, once ebounty can start it.
3. M5 cutover once the bounty child has run live with ebounty's profiles.
